Fixed mobcap changer mod.
This mod allows you to change minecraft spawning mob capacity DYNAMICALLY right in game! Very good for servers!

There are commands like *imc mobcap set <MOBCAP_TYPE> <amount>*. They are for changing values.
And there is command *imc mobcap update*. This is for synchronizing changes with server. Always execute this command after some previous ones!
